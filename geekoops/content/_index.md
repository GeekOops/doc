Collection of awesome SysOps utilities for automated deployment. It is pronounced Geeko-Ops or Geek Oops, depending on your mood :-)

The project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeekOops) and currently consists of a set of `ansible` roles for automated deployment of certain services. The roles are written to be easily usable, minimal yet configurable.

Minimalism is key for GeekOops. Each role is aimed to be self-sufficient, without additional and crazy dependency chains. Each role is also automatically tested to ensure, that the roles remain functional over time.

GeekOops was started in [SUSE Hackweek 2021](https://hackweek.suse.com/20/projects/create-ansible-roles-for-generic-server-stuff). Have a lot of fun!
