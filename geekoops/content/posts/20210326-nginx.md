The [geekoops-nginx role](https://github.com/GeekOops/geekoops-nginx) is a simple Ansible role to install and setup `nginx` on a openSUSE Leap server. This is the first role of the project and kept as simple as possible: It installs `nginx` and optionally opens the firewall ports.

# Example

```yaml

# Example playbook for nginx on jellyfish
- hosts: jellyfish
  user: root
  
  roles:
     - role: geekoops-nginx
       vars:
         setup_default_page: true
         default_page_hostname: "{{ansible_host}}"
         config_firewall: true
         firewall_zone: "public"
```
