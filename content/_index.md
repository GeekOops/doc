title: GeekOops
---
GeekOops is a collection of awesome sysops utilities for automated deployment with a strong focus on openSUSE. Depending on your mood it' pronounced Geeko-Ops or Geek Oops, both is just fine.

The project mainly lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeekOops) and consists of a set of `ansible` roles for automated deployment of certain services. The roles are written to be easily usable, tested, minimal yet configurable.

Simplicity is key for GeekOops. Each role is aimed to be self-sufficient, without crazy and sometimes unsolvable dependency chains. Roles are in general automatically tested to ensure, that they remain functional over time.

GeekOops was started in [SUSE Hackweek 20](https://hackweek.suse.com/20/projects/create-ansible-roles-for-generic-server-stuff) and continued in [SUSE Hack Week 21](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/projects/geekoops-reusable-ansible-roles-for-opensuse) and [Hackweek 22](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/projects/polish-and-improve-ansible-roles-in-geekoops).

Most importantly: Have a lot of fun!
