# How can I contribute?

GeekOops is an open community project, i.e. everyone is welcome to improve existing roles or submit new repositories that fit the general idea.

The project is managed on [github](https://github.com/GeekOops). You can contribute by 

* Creating issues on individual roles
* Creating Pull Requests to improve existing roles
* Push a new repository

Because the number of participants is still low we don't have a hangout place yet but this might change over time.

## Pushing a new repository

The project is open for submission of new automation recipes. For now it consists mostly of ansible roles but submissions that fit the general idea of generic sysop/devops building blocks are more than welcome.

New submissions must fulfill two requirements to be accepted:

1. Fit into the general idea of the project
2. The role must contain some form of automatic testing (with exceptions)

Exceptions to the automatic testing rule can be that the role cannot be (efficiently) tested or that testing does not make sense. Exceptions are allowed but must be justifiable.

### Becoming a geekoops member

Ask to become a member by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/GeekOops/geekoops/issues/new) in the geekoops repository.
