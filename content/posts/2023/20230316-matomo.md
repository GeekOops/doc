The [geekoops-matomo role](https://github.com/GeekOops/geekoops-matomo) is an Ansible role to install and configure `matomo` on an openSUSE Leap server using the `matomo` system package and `apache2`.

If desired, the role also installs and configures MariaDB with a custom database and user for you.

# Example

The following example playbook installs matomo and creates a `matomo` database and database user using the password `password123` (very secure!).


```yaml
---
- hosts: jellyfish
  user: root
  
  roles:
     - role: geekoops-matomo
       vars:
         db_configure: true
         db_name: 'matomo'
         db_user: 'matomo'
         db_pass: 'password123'
         firewall_configure: true
         firewall_zone: 'public'
```
